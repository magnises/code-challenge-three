Coding Challenge Three - Web Components for our angular app
====

### Challenge Requirements:

_Est time: ~55min_

An intern of our created a web forum project a while back. We would like to use it now, but it currently doesn't meet our angular code standards. __Fork__, and start refactoring the application based on [the angular style guide we use](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md), creating web-components for each UI element in the directives folder. If you'd like an example, look at the topic.directive.js inside said folder.

_(You don't need to touch /services and /redactor folders)_

_(Don't worry about finishing any functionality for the app as a whole. The before and after should look almost identical in a web browser, but the code should be much easier to manage and read)_

_(Login creds are inside the server/boot project files)_

After your done, submit a __rebased__ pull request.



### Installation:

```
npm install
```

### Bonus:

mgTopic has unfinished UI elements, listing the date and topic preview. Finish them.
